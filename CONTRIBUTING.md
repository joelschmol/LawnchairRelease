Welcome to the **Lawnchair** Project, we appreciate your interest in contributing. 
Feel free to reach out to us on [Telegram](https://t.me/lccommunity) or [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3x8qNWxgGZ) for any further questions.

### üí´ Bug reports & feature requests

> [!TIP]
> Using Lawnchair [Nightly](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/releases/tag/nightly) is recommended for bug reports and feature requests 
> as it contains the latest changes from Lawnchair.

For [bug reports](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.yaml&title=%5BBUG%5D+), describe the bug in detail to the best of your ability
with steps on how to reproduce it. If applicable, attach log files.

For [feature requests](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature%2Cenhancement&projects=&template=feature_request.yaml&title=%5BFEATURE%5D+), describe the feature you'd like to see added to Lawnchair.
If applicable, attach log files.

Make sure to be civil during the discussion of your contribution as outlined by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### üåê Translation

For translation, visit [Lawnchair on Crowdin](https://lawnchair.crowdin.com) and follow these tips:

-   When using quotation marks, insert the symbols specific to the target language, as listed in this [summary table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table);
-   Some English terminology may have not have commonly-used equivalents in other languages. In such cases, use short descriptive phrases‚Äîfor example, the equivalent of _bottom row_ for _dock_;
-   Some languages (e.g. French) have variations of words depending on if it's masculine or feminine (gender-specific); we recommend opting for gender-neutral words instead.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Code

> [!TIP]
> For Lawnchair 9 to 14, see the branches with the `9-` to `14-` prefixes respectively.

For code, it's highly recommended that you use [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio),
know [Java](https://www.java.com) or preferably [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use Git to clone the repository; ensure that you include the project‚Äôs submodules using the `recursive` flag:
>
> ```
> git clone --recursive https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair.git
> ```

To build **Lawnchair**, select the `lawnWithQuickstepGithubDebug` build type.
Should you face errors relating to the `iconloaderlib` and `searchuilib` projects,
run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

Here are some contribution tips to help you get started:

-   Always make sure that you're up-to-date with **Lawnchair** by setting your base branch to `15-dev`.
-   Make sure your code is logical and well-formatted. If using Kotlin, see [‚ÄúCoding conventions‚Äù in the Kotlin documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html);
-   [The `lawnchair` package](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/tree/15-dev/lawnchair) houses Lawnchair‚Äôs own code, whereas [the `src` package](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/tree/15-dev/src) includes a clone of the Launcher3 codebase with modifications. Generally, place new files in the former, keeping changes to the latter to a minimum.

#### Versioning scheme

As of [#4361](https://github.com/LawnchairLauncher/lawnchair/pull/4361),
Lawnchair‚Äôs version code is composed of four parts, separated by underscores:

        <!-- Direct the accessibility reader to read the point below --->

1. Android major version
2. Android minor version
3. Lawnchair development status
4. Lawnchair development version

##### Android major & minor versions

These represent the Android version in which Lawnchair is based on.
They make up the first two parts of the version code:

-   Major version: Indicates the main Android version.
-   Minor version: Reflects any point release or update within the major version.

Example: Android 11 will be `11_00_XX_XX` while Android 12.1 will be `12_01_XX_XX`.

##### Development status & version

The third and fourth parts of the version code refer to Lawnchair's development stage
and the specific version within that stage:

-   Development status: Shows the current development stage of the Lawnchair build (e.g., Alpha, Beta).
-   Development version: Specifies the incremental version within the same development stage.

The table below shows release phase used by Lawnchair:

| Status            | Stage |
| ----------------- | ----- |
| Development       | 00    |
| Alpha             | 01    |
| Beta              | 02    |
| Release Candidate | 03    |
| Release           | 04    |

Example: Alpha 5 will be `XX_XX_01_05` and Beta 3 will be `XX_XX_02_03`.

#### String naming

Strings `names` in `strings.xml` should follow this format:

| Type                                             | Format            | Example usage              | Actual string        | Other information                                                                                                   |

#### Updating locally stored font listing

Lawnchair uses a locally stored JSON file (`google_fonts.json`) to list available fonts from Google Fonts. This file should be updated periodically or before release to include the latest fonts.

To update Lawnchair's font listing, follow these steps:
1. Acquire a [Google Fonts Developer API key](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api#APIKey).
2. Download the JSON file from `https://www.googleapis.com/webfonts/v1/webfonts?key=API_KEY`, replacing `API_KEY` with the API key from step 1.
3. Replace the content of [`google_fonts.json`](lawnchair/assets/google_fonts.json) with the API response.
