# Lawnchair Visual Guidelines

This directory lists all the decoration & visual explainers used in the Lawnchair Documentation.

All assets created should use Material 3 design with `#47B84F` as source color and the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) ([OFL v1.1](https://github.com/rsms/inter/?tab=OFL-1.1-1-ov-file#readme)) typography. Visit the [Material 3 theme builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/?primary=%2347B84F&bodyFont=Inter&displayFont=Inter&colorMatch=false) for more information, and [the CSS directory](css/) for an example color scheme for the web.

When creating device mockups for Lawnchair, make sure that you're using the latest commits of Lawnchair or use Lawnchair Nightly as base.
